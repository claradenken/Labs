    "## Goal of the project:\n",
    "Goal #1: use selected climate variables in the Northern hemisphere to predict the evolution of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) state in terms of the NAO index with a linear regression model <br>\n",
    "Goal #2: create dashboard to visualize the modeling output\n",
    "\n",

    "## Brief description of the dataset(s):\n",
    "- Feature variables on a global grid (approx. 100 km x 100 km resolution, the regions are specified in the following list) taken from reanalysis ERA5 (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) spanning the time 1980 - 2021\n",
    "\t1. Sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic (October mean  <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SST</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    2. Sea ice concentration in the Arctic (September + October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SIT</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    3. Snow depth in Eurasia (October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SND</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    4. Stratospheric temperature in 100 hPa height in Northern hemisphere (October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">TA</span>, xxx data points) <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target variable: NAO index\n",
    "\t- one mean value for each winter (December 1st â€“ February 28th) for 1980/81-2021/22 - 41 data points\n",
    "    - determined via Principal Component Analysis for sea surface pressure data by the same model\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-level Planning of the project, e.g:\n",
    "- Day 1 - formulate goal and scope\n",
    "- Day 2 - reading and transforming data into manageable format and datatype in jupyter notebook, EDA, data cleaning if necessary\n",
    "- Day 3 - grid point selection process and linear regression modeling\n",
    "- Day 4 - create dashboard and presentation\n",
    "- Day 5 - present project\n"
