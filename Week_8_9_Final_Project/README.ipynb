    "## Goal of the project:\n",
    "Use selected climate variables in the Northern hemisphere to predict the evolution of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) state in terms of the NAO index for winter 2022/23 with a nonlinear regression model based on k-nearest neighbors and a region selection algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brief description of the dataset(s):\n",
    "- Feature variables on a global grid (approx. 100 km x 100 km resolution, the regions are specified in the following list) taken from reanalysis ERA5 (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5), spanning the time 1980 - 2021 for training the model, 2022 as \"test data\" for the prediction\n",
    "\t1. Sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic (October mean  <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SST</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    2. Sea ice concentration in the Arctic (September + October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SIT</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    3. Snow depth in Eurasia (October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">SND</span>, xxx data points)\n",
    "    4. Stratospheric temperature in 100 hPa height in Northern hemisphere (October mean <span style=\"color:#ac3973\">TA</span>, xxx data points) <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Target variable: NAO index\n",
    "\t- one mean value for each winter (December 1st â€“ February 28th) for 1980/81-2021/22 - 41 data points\n",
    "    - determined via Principal Component Analysis for sea surface pressure data by the same model\n",

    "## High-level Planning of the project, e.g:\n",
    "<br> WEEK 1</br>\n",
    "- MON / TUE - formulate goal and scope\n",
    "- WED / THU - preprocessing: read, edit, detrend, standardize, area correction, calculate correlations and p-values, ice mask for sea surface temperature, save\n",
    "- FRI - run sensitivity studies (with cross validation) and save knn predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> WEEK 2</br>\n",
    "- MON - run algorithm that combines different selected regions\n",
    "- TUE - knn predictions\n",
    "- WED / THU - back up time if more time is needed\n",
    "- FRI - create presentation\n",
